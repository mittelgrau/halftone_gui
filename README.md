## Halftone GUI

![preview](./preview.gif)

This is a WIP of a simple Mac Application that converts Images (jpg,png) to a Halftone representation. For me it enables a more playground like workflow for a task that usually requires to open Photoshop. I used PyWebview to try some more lightweight alternatives to a full blown Electron App. Other technologies used are Alpinejs and TailwindCss.

In the future it would be possible to freeze this script via py2app but for now all it needs is to install all python dependencies and run:

`python3 app.py`
